This is a study project made to develop ReactJS and learn it's concepts.

I've build from the start the whole React configuration, not using create-react-app or anything else.

We used Webpack as the compiler.

In this project I've build a ReactJS tasks app following the best praticts for react and css. Also learned about SaSS, useEffect, useState. In order to keep update to new technologies I used typescript as the main language of this project.

The whole project keeps in mind accessibility too, you can navigaton through the app with the keyboard with no problem at all.

For UI/UX design we use Figma with the design build to guide.


## Stacks
